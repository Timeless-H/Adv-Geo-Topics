<!-- css and html code can be mixed as seen in style0.html, where the styling
is included in each tag definition. this way of writing code can be viewed
as a little messy. Thus a much cleaner way of writing css/html code is as
follows -->
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" >
    <title> My Webpage! </title>  <!--shows on the webpage tab-->
    <style>
      h1 {color: #0c8e05;
          text-align: center;}
    </style>
