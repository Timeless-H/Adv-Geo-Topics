## General info
This project is about using Turf.js to add line simplification to your web mapping applications. You will be allowing a user to draw a polyline. 
The user should be able to interact with the web map to show a simplified version of the polyline drawn by the user in a different color.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* Flask
* Bootstrap 4
* Leaflet.js
* Leaflet-draw.js
* Turf.js (a JavaScript library for spatial analysis)

## Demo
The working demo video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/J4h2Di2iaX0) and the live demo can be accessed [here](https://timeless-h.github.io/Lab5/templates/map_page.html)

## Illustrations
