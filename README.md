## General info
This project is a about building a web mapping application for building permits in the city of Calgary, Canada. Users will be able to filter and visualize building permits in Calgary in a mapping front-end. Specifically, users will be able to make queries using specific dates or date ranges. The building permits data is from the City of Calgaryâ€™s Open Calgary API. 

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* Flask
* Bootstrap 4
* Leaflet.js (a JavaScript web mapping API for interactive maps)
* MarkerCluster (a leaflet plugin for handling clustered markers. this plugin also has spiderfy capabilities for handling overlapping markers)

## Demo

## Illustrations
Some images of the homepage and the incident map layer of the web mapping app where we can toggle on/off permits and incidents. When a search is run, the permits are filtered and the selected results are returned.
