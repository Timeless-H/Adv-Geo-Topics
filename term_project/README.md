## Objective
* Design a geo-web mapping application for taxi drop-off/pick-up hotspots in the city of Porto, Portugal for a user-chosen day and time range. 

## General info
In order to build smart cities, it is esential to understand the spatio-temporal social dynamics of that city.
Considering taxis are everywhere and go almost anywhere in aa city at any time, their trajectory data is a good way to
understand spatio-temporal social dynamics, more specifically in the case of this project, the major movements of residents
of a city - which in turn reflect the goto places in a city. Thus, this project is a about building a geo-web mapping application 
for taxi drop-off/pick-up hotspots in the city of Porto, Portugal for a user-chosen day and time range. In essence, users can 
select a day of the week and a time interval, and they will be provided with the possible pick-up/drop-off locations to either get a taxi (a as passenger) or a customer (as a taxi driver).

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* Flask
* Bootstrap 4
* Mapbox Studio
* Mapboxgl.js 
* ArcGIS Pro

## App documentation
This section contains the guide on how to use the designed geo-web map application and an outline of its functionalities

#### Functionalities
* Users can obtain for any day of the week, the possible locations in the city to get a taxi (if a passenger) or a customer (if a taxi driver). 
* For more accurate results, users can further choose from six 4-hour time intervals for possible hotspots within that time frame.
* A legend is provided for efficient comprehension of the various color codes used in the map.

#### User guide
* Download and install (`python 3.7`)
* Download and install and IDE (e.g., Pycharm, VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)
* Using Pycharm as an example:
    * In ur terminal install `Flask` via `pip3 install`
* Download our repository to your working directory, and in the terminal navigate to this working directory. 
* Set the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to be `app.py`. On a Mac or on Linux, the command to do this is `export FLASK_APP=app.py`. 
On Windows, the command is instead `set FLASK_APP=app.py`. This is optionally but you can also set the environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG` to `1` to activate Flaskâ€™s debugger
which will automatically reload your web application whenever you save changes.
* Run flask run to start up the application.

---
* In the `app.py`: 
    * and the `.\interface` route handles the rendering of the web app interface and map in `\templates\interface.html`.
